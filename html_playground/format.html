        <h2>Navigating your U.S. Visa Application Process</h2>
        <p>Students studying in the U.S. generally receive one of three types of visas. The type you need will depend on the type of program you attend:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>F-1 visa: The F-1 visa is the <b>most common option</b> for students who enroll in an academic or English language program in the U.S. It’s for students at a college, university, seminary, or conservatory. The same type of visa is also granted to younger students.</li>
        <li>M-1 visa: The M-1 visa is for students who enroll in a technical program at a non-academic or vocational school, such as a culinary school.</li>
        <li>J-1 visa: The J-1 visa is for certain work- and study-based cultural exchange programs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Before you can <a href="https://www.wes.org/advisor-blog/international-students-guide-moving-to-us-to-study-funding-visas/"><u>begin your visa application</u></a>, you’ll need to get more information from the school or program you would like enroll in. Typically you will need to complete their application process and gain acceptance to the school or program before you can apply for a visa.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Begin the school application process as soon as possible. Even if the semester or program doesn’t start for six months, getting a head start will help you avoid potential deadline-related issues if there are any delays with the school or immigration agencies.</li>
        <li>Complete the visa form from your school. After you have received acceptance into a program, your school’s designated school official (DSO) should send you a form to apply for your visa.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If you are applying for an F-1 or M-1 visa, you will need to complete Form I-20</li>
            <li>If you are applying for a J-1 visa, you will complete Form DS-2019</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>Note: you may need an additional form for a spouse or children who plan on joining you in the U.S.</blockquote>
        <li>Pay required fees. All F-1, M-1, and some J-1 visa applicants need to pay the I-901 Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) fee before applying for their visa. The SEVIS payment portal is available online and students from many countries can pay by credit card. You’ll need to share some personal information along with your SEVIS ID and school code – both of which can be found on your Form I-20 or DS-2019.</li>
        <li>Apply for a visa. After you’ve paid your SEVIS fee, you can then apply for your visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate.</li>
        </ul>
